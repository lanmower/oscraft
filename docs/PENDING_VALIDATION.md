# Pending validation

Phase A changes (owner rule, 2026-11-08, recorded in AGENTS.md) are written and committed locally without builds, tests, gates, witnesses or browser runs. Each entry names the file, the item and the validation Phase B must run before the push. Phase B clears an entry by recording its result in DESIGN.md and deleting the entry here.

## A1. Strike-on-move flag, one-hand path tests

- Files: rust/crates/mod-host/tests/one_hand_strike_on_move.rs (new, three tests).
- Item: the lock's `one_hand` ui call sets `strike_on_move` for the owner's hero only, and the default is off. The client side is js/client/play.js `syncOneHand` (lock engaged sends `one_hand` on); the Lua side is scenarios/moba/controls.lua `sync_strike_on_move`.
- Validation: `cargo test -p mod-host --test one_hand_strike_on_move` (all three pass).
- Status: written, not run.

## A2. Sim strike-on-move (already committed earlier)

- Files: rust/crates/sim/src/combat.rs (attack gate on walking and strike_on_move), arrays.rs, persist.rs (STATE_VERSION 68), hash.rs, rust/crates/mod-host/src/piccolo_host.rs (native set_strike_on_move), rust/crates/sim/tests/strikes.rs.
- Item: a walking unit strikes its target in reach only when strike_on_move is set; a plain move order does not strike.
- Validation: `cargo test -p sim --test strikes` (both move-order tests), then `cargo test -p sim`.
- Status: the two strikes tests passed before the Phase rule; re-run in Phase B.

## A3. Strike-target hook (uncommitted before this phase)

- Files: rust/crates/web/src/lib.rs (`Game::unit_strike_of`, bounds-checked wrapper over `commanded_strike_index`), js/client/play.js (`window.__ciStrikeOf`).
- Item: the witness can read a unit's committed strike target by unit id. `unit_strike_target` is alive-filtered and indexes by position, so it cannot answer for a given unit id.
- Validation: the wasm must be rebuilt (`WASM=1 SKIP_PACKS=1 bash scripts/dev/stage.sh`, then `node scripts/dev/serve.mjs`); the witness in A4 must return a non-null target for the hero (`targetsSeen` non-empty in the green legs).
- Status: written, not built.

## A4. Live witness: strike while walking

- Files: scripts/witness/strike-while-walking.mjs (new). It exports `LEGS`, `CONFIG`, `strikeWhileWalkingLeg` (page-side), `verdict` (pure) and `runWitness(page)`.
- Item: three legs in one match (one-hand on, off, on). The red run is the one-hand-off leg, which matches attack() before the fix. A leg counts only when the hero is in reach while moving, so the red run proves the flag and not the geometry.
- Owner filter: `__ciHostile(me, owner)` takes player ids (rust/crates/web/src/lib.rs `hostile(a, b)` is player-indexed). The earlier witness passed unit ids, so its filter marked allied units hostile. The module uses player ids.
- Validation: one bounded playwriter run (docs/BROWSER_WITNESSES.md), staged from HEAD with SKIP_PACKS=1. Import the module from the gm playwriter code and call `runWitness(state.page)`; if dynamic import is unavailable there, paste the module's functions into the code. Record the three legs and the verdict in DESIGN.md. `CONFIG.stage` (78.5, 82) and `CONFIG.minStartHp` (200) are map and hero values to check against the live match.
- Earlier run, not valid: MCP task kufn44cj7 used a pre-module witness on the browser at port 8831. Its three legs each recorded 0 strikes and `readyAtFullHp: false` (hero hp 258, 303, 348 against a 560 threshold), so the legs did not start from full health and the run proves nothing. It must be rerun through the module.
- Status: written, not run.

## A5. Browser witness spec, four witnesses

- Files: docs/BROWSER_WITNESSES.md (four witnesses; strike-while-walking added with its red-run rule), scripts/check-browser-witnesses.mjs (checks the fourth witness name).
- Validation: `node scripts/check-browser-witnesses.mjs` prints `browser witness spec ok (4 witnesses, 4 bounded-run rules)`.
- Status: written, not run.

## A6. Two-phase rule

- Files: AGENTS.md (Invariants bullet, owner rule 2026-11-08).
- Validation: none beyond the gate in B1.
- Status: written.

## B1. Gate and gm run

- Command: `node scripts/check-all.mjs`, run through the gm run, baseline `RESULT gates=73 ok=73 failed=0 drift=0 skipped=6 strict=false`.
- Covers: A1 through A5 (check-browser-witnesses is a gate entry; the Rust tests run through cargo, not the gate).
- Status: not run.

## Pillar slopes (no pending change)

- Committed in a15ca5da. `node scenarios/moba/tools/check-pillar-coverage.mjs` reported `ok (56 of 56 impassable slope cells decorated, one prop each)` on 2026-11-08, and map.osd has 56 pillar-rock prop lines. No A-phase change touches the pillars.
- Validation in B1 only, through the gate.

## Notes for Phase B (observations, not validation)

- A hero walks about 4.7 cells per second on the live map. Reads taken one second apart can look like a stalled hero; use the position log over several seconds.
- Earlier reports of a hero "stuck" at the fountain were not established: one run ended with the hero mid-path and one with the hero at low health. Do not treat the stall as a cause until B-phase logs show it.
- The dev server started for the witness (port 8831) is still running under PID 2961824. Stop it by PID after the B-phase witness.
